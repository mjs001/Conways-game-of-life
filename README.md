# Conways-game-of-life
My own take on Conway's Game of Life

Deployment: https://conways-game-of-life-kohl.vercel.app/

Controls:

Press "Run" to run the simulation.

Press "Stop" to stop the simulation.

press "random" for a randomly generated board.

press "clear" to clear the grid.

press "Red" to change the individual pixel to a red color.

press "Blue" to change the individual pixel to a blue color.

Enter the amount of milliseconds you want the simulation to run at in the input box that says "100".

Two Ways to play:

1. Click individual cells and make them "alive" or "dead" by simply tapping them once or twice. Then you can run the simulation.

2. Click random and a randomly generated board will appear. Then run the simulation.
